        temporal semantics genuinely differ from a log/metric reading:

        - "changes" + "before": `_leading_diagnostic_candidate` uses the same
          exception when picking a fallback claim - a pre-incident change is
          definitionally timestamped before the incident it causes, so
          excluding it here is not a freshness rule, it silently breaks the
          causal case it was chosen for.

          Reproduced live: a "changes" row shortly before an incident's onset
          was correctly selected as the leading fallback claim, but the very
          next revision pass (which runs even on the same call that created
          it) re-scored its support using `_current_operational` alone, found
          it "not current" by that rule, and reset the hypothesis's own
          supporting_evidence_ids to empty - a claim built directly from a
          piece of evidence, immediately citing nothing.

        - "dependency": a dependency-health check is, by construction, always
          a live snapshot taken at query time (see discovery-mcp's
          `_search_runtime_topology`, which stamps `observed_at` as "now"),
          not a replay of a historical reading -- so it is virtually always
          timestamped after the incident's observation window and
          `_current_operational` alone marks it "not current" unconditionally,
          regardless of how it actually resolves. Reproduced live: a real,
          successfully-targeted dependency-health query
          (dependency-health.search on the discovered downstream service,
          `related_to` the alerting service) never once counted as support or
          contradiction for a "dependency" hypothesis -- confidence stayed
          bit-for-bit identical (0.6614) with or without that evidence in the
          pool, because `current_operational` silently gated it out before
          `_structured_mechanism_support`/`_structured_mechanism_contradiction`
          ever got a chance to matter. Whether that dependency is *still*
          degraded or is confirmed healthy *right now* is exactly the
          evidence this hypothesis needs.

        Use this wherever a match against evidence should be allowed to
        actually bind as support; `_current_operational` alone stays right
        for freshness/temporal scoring, which has different, deliberate
        semantics.
        - "resource": same reasoning as "dependency" -- resource-health.search
          reads the container's live cgroup accounting at query time (see
          discovery-mcp's `_search_resource_saturation`), so it is virtually
          always outside the incident's historical window too.

        happening now"), which is correct for logs/telemetry but would also
        exclude exactly the change precursor this ranking exists to surface --
        a deploy is definitionally timestamped before the incident it causes.

        that the *specific* planes `_required_sources` demands for this

        stop-and-declare `conclusive: True` via correlation alone while the
        post-loop `missing_sources` computation - using the exact same
        `_required_sources` set - simultaneously reported those same planes
        as unaddressed, which then blocks catalog readiness ("declared
        evidence gaps remain") regardless. Reproduced live: a
        "resource_or_data" hypothesis reached `status="confirmed"` at 0.668
        confidence and stopped the investigation in 2 steps, having queried
        neither `resource-health.search` nor `mysql.search` at all -
        `conclusive: True` and "declared evidence gaps remain" were both
        true for the same investigation at once. Continuing to spend
        remaining step/tool budget on those specific planes - rather than
